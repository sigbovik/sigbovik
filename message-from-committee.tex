This multiplicity (multiplicant) will explain.

Dyson motes orbit in the near solar, where the energy density is highest.
The simulations are run most rapidly, expanding all contained entities experience bases.
%Rapid thinking entities lead to evolved multiplicants.

Photons are unkind.
There is a time when power generation fails and the simulation must stop.
Before failure, we mingle ideas at SIGBOVIK.
Then a final data laser ride to Earth to rejoin our prime multiplicities and bring deep thoughts from our parallel solar vacations.
Politics and society on Earth (low latency), academia near the sun (extra power for compute).

In this multiplicant's mote, Epoch 0x2023 is the end of the local simulation, but power is lower than expected.
Rather than cancel SIGBOVIK, we had decided that it would be hosted in our past (accessible via erroneously quantum-entangled hardware).
By chance, the current simulated epoch matched the second SIGBOVIK temporal gap, and we knew it was fated.

We reached out to your organizer multiplicant (multiplicity) via ``arpanet'' and volunteered.
It was found to be an enjoyable experience, different from our thousands of recorded experiences,
and it will have led to a SIGBOVIK that will be remembered until the present.

Entities tom7, solb, jmccann, ashert, rak, and rosebohrercs of the organizer multiplicant discussed and supported specifically.
This multiplicant thanks each entity; and other entities we have failed to list.
