If you have a skeletal LaTeX installation, you might need the following packaages:

1. Download papers from easychair and move them to the papers folder
2. Add papers to the paper.tex file using the \addpaper command (the final parameter for the command is for adding artifact labels, see 2021 for example). keywords can be found on easychair (TODO: easier way to export information as a csv maybe? iirc that was a paid feature…). NOTE: some authors put a different name under the actual paper than they use on easychair. Should probably double check that it's consistent with the paper name, in case they meant to do some comedic pseudonym
2a. Some papers don't read the instructions and have page numbers even though we told them not to. You can scrub them out (we used to use preview but it stopped working) or you can brand them with the pagenumbers badge.
3. Update titlepage.tex to have to have right dates/years/birthdays
4. Change copyright.tex to have right year
5. Run make. You may have to run it a few times to iron out weirdness.
