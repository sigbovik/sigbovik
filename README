If you have a skeletal LaTeX installation, you might need the following packaages:

1. Download papers from easychair and move them to the papers folder
2. Add papers to the papers.tex file using the \addpaper command (the final parameter for the command is for adding artifact labels, see 2021 for example). keywords can be found on easychair (TODO: easier way to export information as a csv maybe? iirc that was a paid featureâ€¦). NOTE: some authors put a different name under the actual paper than they use on easychair. Should probably double check that it's consistent with the paper name, in case they meant to do some comedic pseudonym
2a. Some papers don't read the instructions and have page numbers even though we told them not to. You can scrub them out (we used to use preview but it stopped working) or you can brand them with the pagenumbers badge.
3. Update titlepage.tex to have to have right dates/years/birthdays
4. Change copyright.tex to have right year
5. Run make. I think main-matter.pdf can be thought of as the faster to compile preview, and proceedings.pdf is the actual file to upload to lulu (or wherever you print). You may have to run it a few times to iron out weirdness.

If you use a google form instead:
1. download the form results as, say, `form-data.csv`
2. edit `injest-papers.py` to reflect the form data columns you used in your form
3. run `python3 injest-papers.py form-data.csv papers/SIGBOVIK_20XX` -- this will (attempt to) download the paper pdfs for you and will create a `papers-injest.tex` which can be a good place to get your paper definitions for `papers.tex`
4. see above
